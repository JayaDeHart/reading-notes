# Class 4 Reading

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  1. Forces you to set clear requirements for your code
  2. Provides access to testing just by entering one script
  3. Saves time long run
## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
  In case you need to mock a new instance of some environment, like a database for each test
## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
Costs time upfront
## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
ES6 Classes are a "syntactic sugar" version of constructor/prototype classes designed to behave more like class based languages. 
## Why REST?
Its simple but effective, contains all the CRUD operations / HTTP verbs

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

#### functional programming
building high level programming on a basis of individual immutable programs
#### object-oriented programming (OOP)
programming built arond reusable classes or object prototypes
#### class
a construct that has properties and methods, and of which instances can be created
#### super
used to access a class's parent 
#### this
a very complicated word that can among other things refer to the current object in a constructor function
#### Test Driven Development (TDD)
write tests first, write code second
#### Jest
both a test runner and an assertion library
#### Continuous Integration (CI)
automating the system by which you test and integrated branches of code into the main branch
#### REST
REpresentational State Transfer
#### Data Model
A schema / design that defines what individual documents / rows of data can be entered into a collection/table

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  1. SQL vs NOSQL
  2. Using DBs with heroku
  3. Writing "SQL" in Javascript
### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
1. Testing in a database environment
2. Doing more complex things with sequelize
3. Writing more middleware
### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
1. Writing more refined / specific tests
2. performing more complex sql actions in js
3. Writing more middleware
