## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Why is access control important?
So you can easily protect certain routes from only some types of users.
### Describe an application that would need access control.
AWS dev console has a system of access control for the different services available on the platform
### What is a role used for?
To set a predefined level of access to different resources
